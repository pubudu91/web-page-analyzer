Web Page Analyzer
==================

How to Run
----------
Can either use `go run .` or build it using `go build` and then run the resulting `web-page-analyzer` artifact.

If needed, host and port can be configured as follows:
$ ./web-page-analyzer -host=127.0.0.1 -port=9090

By default the service runs on localhost:8080
